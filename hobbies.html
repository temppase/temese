                      Music
                    </h5>
                  <div class="p-5">
                    Composing and improvising music are things I like and have invested in. 
                    Sometimes I might play a few chords in a loop and then start improvising riffs, 
                    melodies and solos on it. <br><br> I like the painting and sensation of soundscapes more than 
                    machine-like technical playing, although I myself have tried to hone the playing technique 
                    and ergonomics as functional as possible. <br><br> I also invest a lot in sounds because they are 
                    part of the soundscape. I try to explore how I can create different impressions with sound and 
                    what kind of sound sounds good and alive.

                    </h5>
                  <div class="p-5">
                    I try to play sports in many ways. 
                    However, not because it is somehow mandatory, but I try to find some kind of counterbalance 
                    to it in everyday life. At the moment, I wish I might be in a slightly better shape, but on 
                    the other hand, I try to accept the situation and live by it. I have run a half marathon and 
                    my best time was exactly 2 hours. Not a peak time but I'm pretty happy with it. <br><br> In the winter 
                    I like to ski whenever possible.<br> During the summer, I try to go snorkeling whenever I 
                    have time <br> (Finnish summer is short).

                    workout.

                      Reading & Movies
                  </h5>
                <div class="p-5">
                  Reading has been a way for me to make imaginative journeys and possibly learn something new about 
                  life and humanity. I have read from Umberto Eco e.g. The Name of the Rose, Foucault's Pendulum, 
                  Baudolino and The Island of the Day Before. <br><br>
                  I have read a lot of books from Kurt Vonnegut. 
                  I like his sarcastic black humor. 
                  My favorite works were Titan’s Sirens, Cat’s Cradle and Slaughterhouse 5. <br><br>
                  I’ve watched so many movies that I don’t even make any lists of them. 
                  I usually watch movies on a whim, but I'm familiar with e.g. To the films of Akira Kurosawa, 
                  Federico Fellini and Andrei Tarkowski. Sometimes I also like analyzing movies.

                  This is a pretty new hobby for me. 
                  In the spring I put basil seeds and garden lovage seeds in the soil. 
                  In addition to those I had bought sage seedling.

                  <br>
                  The germination box unfortunately dripped and I lost most of the basils and garden lovages. 
                  The picture shows the surviving basilicas, one of which I have yet to remove.
